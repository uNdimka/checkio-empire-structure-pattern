We need to experiment on various atomic structures for the crystals we've harvested,
but our equipment is in rough shape needs improvement.
For starts you should know how to recognize simple row structures even without details:
the atoms comprising the crystalline structure are represented as digits and letters.
The first patterns we check will be simple and the system
will only need to recognize the order of the digits and letters.
Unfortunately, our computer can only store integers and convert them into binary format for comparison.
As a result we need a program which can compare a pattern with a given atomic structure.
